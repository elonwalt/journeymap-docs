Licensing
=========

JourneyMap is distributed under an All Rights Reserved license. This
means that you may not alter, host or distribute JourneyMap yourself.

What you CAN do
---------------

* Create a modpack containing JourneyMap, as long as JourneyMap is
  downloaded from CurseForge as part of the modpack installation
  or launch process.

  This includes modpacks hosted directly on CurseForge, or modpacks
  that make use of Technic Solder (as long as you're not creating a
  zip file that contains all of the mods).

* If you're using solder.io with Technic to allow each user to
  download the mod directly from CurseForge, you may also include
  JourneyMap.

* Interact and make use of our open-source projects `on GitHub`_ under
  the terms of the individual licenses of those projects.

* Decompile the mod for the purpose of inspecting how it works and 
  what it does, under the relevant laws in the USA.

* Work with our mod contrary to this license **when given explicit
  written permission to do so by techbrew**.

What you CANNOT do
------------------

* Modify the mod in any way, even for personal use.

* Re-host, redistribute or bundle the mod in any way, including as
  part of a larger distribution such as a modpack. This includes
  Technic modpacks that bundle all of the mods into a single zip
  file.

  If you're unhappy with the way Technic handles this, please feel
  free to drop a comment on `this GitHub issue`_.

* Decompile our mod or extract the contents of the JAR and make use
  of the code or assets therein for any purpose.

* Extract code or assets from our otherwise open-source projects from
  the mod JAR and make use of them. The JAR itself is distributed under
  an All Rights Reserved license. If you want to work with our 
  open-source projects, please find them `on GitHub`_ instead.

Approved launchers
------------------

The following launchers are all explicitly approved for use with JourneyMap,
providing they continue to meet the above licensing conditions.

* ATLauncher_ is `granted direct link permission`_ to include JourneyMap
  in both public and private modpacks.

* FeedTheBeast_ is granted permission to include JourneyMap in both public and
  private modpacks.

* MCUpdater_ is granted permission to link to JourneyMap on CurseForge in
  serverpack XML files.

* MultiMC_ is granted permission to install modpacks containing JourneyMap provided
  the modpacks are in CurseForge format and download JourneyMap from CurseForge.

* `The Pixelmon Launcher`_ is granted permission to link to JourneyMap on CurseForge
  in both public and private modpacks.

* `The SKCraft launcher`_ (or a fork, assuming it meets the above conditions) is granted
  permission to use the `custom URL mechanism`_ to link to JourneyMap on CurseForge
  in both public and private modpacks.

* `The Twitch client`_ is granted permission to include JourneyMap in both
  public and private modpacks.

Other notes
-----------

You don't need to notify us if you make use of JourneyMap in your modpack, but we do like
to hear from users that enjoy our work and it helps us to know how JourneyMap is being
used. If you like, feel free to send a tweet to `@JourneyMapMod`_ with the name of your
modpack and the launcher you're using!

If you have any questions about our licensing (or wish to report a violation), please feel 
free to contact us directly `on Discord`_.
